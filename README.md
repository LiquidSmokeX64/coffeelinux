# Coffee-Linux (Script-Installed Arch-Linux for Gamers)
[Description]
Key Features: Arch-Based, BTRFS installation, Hybridized Desktop Environment/s, Pipewire, VAAPI on Chrome (with game streaming in mind), FirewallD, and SystemD-Boot.

A script designed to install a unique Coffee-Linux Experience via Arch easily, and semi painlessly.
(vaapi chrome-flags.conf and premade Stadia app are located in /opt folder. place chrome-flags.conf in ~/.config/ folder, and the stadia app file in ~/.local/share/applications/ folder. and reboot after launching chrome and it fails once. Enjoy.)
This Installer will create an Coffee-Linux install.

Features: 
1. Pure Arch foundation using official repos (and a little AUR here and there)
1a. ISO built on a running install of itself with archiso.
2. A Cinnamon/Gnome Desktop Environment (Always the latest version)
2a. Coffee wallpapers in user pictures folder and default location.
2b. Blended Cinnamon DE and Gnome, yet uses LightDM/Muffin, the gnome backend just smoothes it out a bit.
4. Linux Mint Themes, Sounds, Icons, and Backgrounds installed via yay during os install.
5. Pamac Graphical Software Manager (Select "1 4" in part 4 when prompted for pamac-aur for full functionality)
6. Chrome Preinstalled via yay (not Firefox)
8. Latest Pipewire & Wireplumber for the best possible sound.
9. Many gaming frameworks preinstalled so you can get to it right away.
10. Prebuilt with Steam, Wine, Winetricks, Protontricks, and DXVK for the best possible gaming experiences out of the box.
11. SystemD boot (as opposed to GRUB).
12. Yay for CLI installation of AUR applications.
13. FirewallD (Better configuration than the standard one)
14. Easy install via Installer on desktop (must be altered to executable/trusted)
14a. Open Desktop as root (right-click anywhere) and launch the installer way because it needs elevated privlages to install the OS.

Note: This is designed for PCs with UEFI, Intel CPUs, and Nvidia GPUs, AMD install WILL LIKELY fail because absolutely no AMD specific packages are installed.

Note-3: You will have to use fdisk to prepare your drive during installation.

Instructions are as follows: For most things you just answer yes to if asked as I have already prepared everything in a certain order for your convenience.

1: Boot a Coffee Linux live iso.
1a: download link to mega: https://mega.nz/file/ECkCUCZB#Gf3tnU0aFX8jAlpO6F4pbLoGNGljb0A4_zTAADN-1mE
2: run the installer,
3: enter your username, drive id, and partition numbers (easy to find out)
4: partition the drive chosen with fdisk. (you need 1G for efi, 8~64G for swap, and the rest of the drive for the OS/Home.)
5: hit yes alot when asked lol.
6: remove the "#" from the multilib entries in the file it brings up (if needed), ctrl+S,ctrl+x to save and exit the editor.
7: let it do its thing. make choices involving pipewire and fonts, stupid stuff like that.
8: set the root password, user password, and the temp user password (needed to automate yay install).
9: enter the temp user password once.
10: yay installs come next (they will ask for the user password alot, sorry).
11: it will fix lightdm and the greeter, and copy over coffee related files to /opt and user home directories, then reboot automattically if successful.
12: Login, open chrome once (it will likely fail, this is normal), then reboot.

==================================================
Alternate Method
==================================================
1a:  Boot an official Arch Linux ISO in UEFI mode.

2a: Enter: pacman -Syy

3a: Enter: pacman -Syy --noconfirm archlinux-keyring

4a: Enter: pacman -S --noconfirm git

5a: Enter: git clone https://liquidsmokex64/arch-linux-installer.git

6a: Enter: bash /arch-linux-installer/coffeebrewer.sh
===============================================================
follow normal installer procedure from step 2 of the live iso.
===============================================================
3: enter your username, drive id, and partition numbers (easy to find out)
4: partition the drive chosen with fdisk. (you need 1G for efi, 8~64G for swap, and the rest of the drive for the OS/Home.)
5: hit yes alot when asked lol.
6: remove the "#" from the multilib entries in the file it brings up (if needed), ctrl+S,ctrl+x to save and exit the editor.
7: let it do its thing. make choices involving pipewire and fonts, stupid stuff like that.
8: set the root password, user password, and the temp user password (needed to automate yay install).
9: enter the temp user password once.
10: yay installs come next (they will ask for the user password alot, sorry).
11: it will fix lightdm and the greeter, and copy over coffee related files to /opt and user home directories, then reboot automattically if successful.
12: Login, open chrome once (it will likely fail, this is normal), then reboot.

7: Follow the prompts as needed. (mostly just password prompts and confirmation/overwrite dialogues lol)

That should finish it off for you. Enjoy your Coffee. Spread the word! Coffee is hot over here.
